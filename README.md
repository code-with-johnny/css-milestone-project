# CSS Milestone Project

A CSS project template for the software developer roadmap.

We return to Joseph The Cat's portfolio to make it look a little more modern. The goal is to get you acquainted with different aspects of CSS, such as selectors, animations, responsive design, etc.

## Getting Started

To get started on this project, run the following command in your terminal.

```
git clone git@github.com:code-with-johnny/css-milestone-project.git && cd css-milestone-project
```

If you open up the project in vscode, you should see a folder called `styles` which contains an `index.css` file. This file will need to be linked to the `index.html` (for you to figure out how to do).

You can have more than one css file and import them into the `index.css` if you choose to (allows for smaller files and more organised code).

## Requirements

1. The styling that you'll see in the example gifs below is achieved using <em>only</em> css (no preprocessors or JavaScript).
2. You should import an external font of your choosing (check out the google font API). The font used in the examples is Montserrat.
3. The image of Joseph The Cat in the Home section should be animated onto the page on initial page load. You can use any animation you'd like (see examples section for an example).
4. The site should be fully responsive, meaning that when you grow and shrink your browser window, the app should still look good and nothing should run off the page horizontally.
5. The colors used are entirely up to you, but feel free to copy the palette I chose.
